## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL (for local development)
- Git

---

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aman031298/ToDo_List.git
    cd ToDo_List/backend
    ```

2. **Set up the MySQL database** (for local development):
   - Create a database called `todolist_db`.
   - In the `src/main/resources/application.properties`, update the connection details:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/todolist_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
    ```

3. **Build the backend**:

    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```

4. **Run the backend application**:

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

5. **Open the application**:
   - The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

6. **Run the frontend**:
   - Open the `frontend/index.html` file in a browser to view the application.

2. **Create a new project**:
   - From your Railway dashboard, click on "New Project".
   - Choose the option to "Deploy from GitHub" and select this repository.

3. **Configure the environment variables**:
   - In the Railway dashboard, go to the "Environment" section.
   - Add the following environment variables for database connection:
     - `DB_URL`
     - `DB_USERNAME`
     - `DB_PASSWORD`

4. **Push your code**:
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy your Spring Boot application.

5. **Access the backend**:
   - Once deployed, Railway will provide a URL to access your backend API.

### Notes:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   For Railway, make sure to set up the database environment variables (`DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD`) in the Railway dashboard.

2. **Ensure JAR file is built**:
   Before deploying, ensure your Spring Boot project is properly built into a `.jar` file. If not, use the following Maven command to build it:

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
